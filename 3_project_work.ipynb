    "- **Test:**  ~81% `neutral_or_negative`, ~19% `positive`\n",
    "\n",
    "I trained a TF–IDF + Logistic Regression model with `class_weight=\"balanced\"`. On the test set (26 comments) the classifier achieves:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `neutral_or_negative`: precision **0.91**, recall **1.00**, F1-score **0.95** (21 comments)  \n",

    "- **Overall accuracy:** **0.92**  \n",
    "- **Macro F1:** **0.85**\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the model is **very reliable at detecting neutral or negative feedback** and rarely mislabels it as positive. It still misses about 40% of the positive comments, so a few appreciative responses may be classified as neutral_or_negative, but overall it gives a strong high-level view of student satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommendations Based on Topics + Sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Strengthen interactive teaching and group work (Topic 1)**  \n",
    "   Many comments in this topic are positive. The course should continue to use group activities, engagement and quizzes to keep students active.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Improve clarity and consistency of materials (Topics 2 & 4)**  \n",
    "   Since slides, notes, labs and journals appear frequently, ensuring they are well-structured, clear and uploaded on time can reduce confusion and support learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Review assessment difficulty and workload (Topic 3)**  \n",
    "   Because assessments and workload are a recurring theme, the unit team could review the number, timing and difficulty of CATs and lab tasks, and provide more guidance or examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Increase real-world BI application (Topic 5)**  \n",
    "   Real-life BI examples and practical application are strongly appreciated. Adding more case studies, real datasets and mini-projects can further improve student satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combined topic and sentiment pipeline can be re-used on future course evaluations to monitor how these themes and their associated sentiments evolve over time."
